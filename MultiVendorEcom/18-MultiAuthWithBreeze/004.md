Hello, friend.Welcome back.In our previous video, we successfully installed that breeze package and also we migrate all that our database table, right?So that is all that our database table.Great.So now friend, I want to do here on you see some of the data that means with the seeder I want to do on to add some of the data because that should be different type of data.One will be as admin, another role will be as a vendor and the role will be as a user.Right now let's do that work for doing this.I want to do one to create the seeder.That means in our database, into the database that is a seeders by default that is on the database seeders.Now we're going to create another new one if we are to create one of the new seeder file here.Here, that is our project in the project area here.Now, I didn't run another command as a PHP, okay, I better I make it a little bit big size.So now it's perfect.So now that it will be the PHP and artisan and then that will be the mic.I want to run the seed so that will be the seeder I can see there.And now I name it all the new seed name, I just name it as a users user stable table seeder.So that will be the user table seeder.Okay.So now that is our common line as a PHP and makes it there as a user table.See the now user table.See that that is all the name it should be created.One of the seeder in our particular seeders folder.Okay, now let's create it.Now if you click as the enter and you can see there is a seed architect successful and in our seeders and that is our have created on the new one as a seeders table that is our user stable seeder.So now that is our file grade.So here in our function that is on the default function as a function run here.Now we have to do we have to insert some of the data in our table out inserted in our user table.Right?So right now that is all that our field I want to done to update it.So that is our run.So first of all and to do and to better puts on the node for you that will be for the admin.And also I want to create another one for the vendor and then the user.So like that is our admin, that is actually our functions into the functions area here.Here I wanted to add that machine, insert all the data.So here I want to insert with the query builder.So I want to use that as a DB, that is our DB and our DB table table or table name which table.Here we have to add that our table name, if you go our table name as a users table, you can see here now on insert this that I copied, now that will be the users create.And now here I want to do want to insert, right, so that will be the insert.So here I simply use that as an insert and now I want to do want to pass all that object data one by one.Okay, here.Now first of all, I want to do better.I want to make it as a here that will be form to this position.So that is our admin part for the admin.All the data.I want to destroy it in here.So like, first of all, I want to do that is our object, all the data.So one by one I want to add all that our object data.So first of all, that will be our filename as the name is a name email and then the password and also on to pass some of the role.I have already make that photo, phone and address as in Annabelle.So if they have no data is totally fine.If you go here you can see I have already make that all that are three of this field as anonymous.So if they have no data is totally fine, it will be not giving you any error.And I want to add some of the data in our role and into the status.Okay, So now let's do that work for doing this.First of all, I want to name it as a name and name.I want to use it or the default name.Name does it, the admin.I make it as admin, so that will be the name.Great.And then I'm going to use it.And the user name.User name, user name.Also I want to do and to make it as a admin.So that will be the admin user name.Great, great.And also don't take another one, the beta, copy it, copy it and then paste it and replace.So the field like that, it will be as a name and make it as the admin part of the name.Actually you choose.This will be stored this data and the user name will be as the admin.And then I want to take our another one as an email.Right.Email.And then that will be the password.And then role is status.So I make it as the email.That will be the email that will be another one as a password password and also take another free name as a rule, make sure spelling is correct because that is all that our database field name, because there is a rule and then there is status.So make it as we start us the US grid.So you start us by default.I have passed two of these things.I have passed that as inactive or rather than that active, right?So I make it as a by default as the active, so I may copy it and then that will be stored as the active in our role role and.To do and to use it.I have passed that as the admin vendor and the user, so that will be the admin for the admin.I want to use it as the admin create.That will be the admin and password I want to do here.That will be one of the hash password here.I want to jointly store this on the hash password.So if you want stored this hash password, that means you will make this password as a hash.So I want to make it as a hash hash and then I'm going to make it as a make how many character length you want to add.You can actually add it.So I want to make it as a111.So that will be our password range.Perfect.And when you use that as a hash, also we have to do we have to load that hash hash it comes from if you go to that app, if HTTP controller auth authenticated session, there is a new you can see that the hash has it will be comes from the support facade and then the hash from this position.I copy it.Now I want to add it and also here I have used it as a DB.So also you have to do have to load that DB so I make it as a use and then.DB Great can create and then the email email will be as I make it, as admin at the Gmail's gmail dot com.So the step up on the email data will be inserted when I run it, then everything will be more clear.So that is all that our field and here it will be at some of the demo data.So now I simply add it.So that will be for our admin rate.And also I want to undertake our another part that will be for the vendor.I copy it and then I paste it.Okay, so that will be for the vendor, so that will be for the vendor.For the vendor.I want to use it.The name will be as a vendor, OC vendor or whatever the name actually choose like as a vendor.If you want to use that as a vendor, then that will be the Arian vendor.Right now is fine.Better.I want to make it as Zarian vendor and then that is our user name.Let me use a name.I make it as a vendor vendor and then email.I want to make it as a vendor at the read gmail.com.Password will be just like that.Same.Our role will be.Our role will be as a vendor right here.I have already name it as a vendor.So now that will be as a vendor.I make it as a role, will be as a vendor and instead as I also want to make it as active for the vendor read now better copy it and also add another data for the user.So that will be as user, user or customer, whatever you choose and make it as a user.The user and our customer wants a customer.So now I want to do a name it or name will be as a user.So I make it as a of the name, as a user or user name will be as a user.And then email I want to do one to make it as a user at the at the gmail.com password will be just like that same role will be.I make it as a user role because here I have used that as a user, right?So now that will be as a user role and instead as I make it as a active, great, great so friend,that's all you have to do, okay?That's all you have to do better on to make it a little bit close.So that is it.Now they have the app, see some of the inserts of the data.I have used it as the admin part that is the for the vendor part and also that is for the customer for it.So now I want to do also to generate some of the fake data.So how to do this work.But I want to continue this process.In the next video I will show you that things with the live example.So thanks for watching.I will see you the next video.
